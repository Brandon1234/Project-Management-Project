A system is a combination of software and hardware that provides a solution for a business problem.
A system involves clients, analysts, designers, developers, testers, users, and more.
Success can be measured based on the following questions: Does it solve the problem? Is it easy to maintain? Is it scalable? Is there a support system in place? Was it delivered on time? Was the client happy with the results?
Computer scientists have created a view of the software development process known as the ‘software development life cycle’ (SDLC).
One SDLC method is known as the waterfall method, where a mistake in one phase requires the developer to go back and redo some work from a previous phase.
The waterfall method was developed by Dr. Winston Royce in 1970, based on his experience making software for spacecraft missions. It consists of various phases: Problem Statement, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Integration/Test, and Maintenance.
Mistakes found early in the SDLC are much less expensive to correct than those found late.
One method used to keep track of progress is called the Gantt Chart, and was developed by an engineer called Henry Gantt.
Gantt Charts are typically used by people working on a large project, such as the Hoover Dam, and the Eisenhower National Defense Interstate Highway System.
Unified Modeling Language, or UML visually specifies parts of a system, and makes it much easier to describe complex software designs.
